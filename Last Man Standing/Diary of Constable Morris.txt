A plague has broken out in the Market District. We're not exactly sure where it came from, but we've been given orders to quarantine citizens and mark infected areas. It's gonna be a long week.

Great, just great. Not only do we have to deal with this plague nonsense, but now we've got to prepare for an incoming attack from some nasty Huntsmen who want to get into the city. This job can be some real shite sometimes.

They've got the upper hand. I am the only one left. God help me.

I'm bleeding out, but I won't give up so easily. It's time I end these unwashed pests.
